Summary
=======

- Knowing big O notation will make you a better developer.
- The problem it solves is defining the rule to talk about algorithm complexity.
- There are small number of function to talk about complexity that are used in real life,
  you already know about half of them.
- Complexity is not an execution time, but a quite related.
- Now you could calculate complexity in a simple cases.
