In my opinion there are 3 reasons to know about it.

Efficient code
--------------

Web developers don't work with big data often.
Simple common sense helps a lot:

* Do not process to many things, let database do the work.
* Do not repeat costly operations

What about other jobs where this is important?
Do worry if you don't know how to do it, you won't be hired.


Good code
---------

Using right datastructure for your code probably won't affect performance.
But it will make your intention more clear and you will get respect from you colleagues.


Coding interview
----------------

There are 2 types of interview.

* Talk about programming.
  Chance to have question about datastructures is super high.
* Solve the problem interview.
  You need to use right datastructures and talk about complexity.

Summary
-------
This really helps to write a better code and find a better job.
