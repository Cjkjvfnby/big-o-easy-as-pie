Summary
=======

- Knowing big O notation will make you a better developer.
- The problem it solves is defining the rule to talk about algorithm complexity.
- To talk about complexity, you should know a couple of big O cases.
  We already touched most of them, like iteration, item access. Missed are sorting and tree height.
- Complexity is not an execution time, but a quite related.
- Now you could calculate complexity in a simple cases.
